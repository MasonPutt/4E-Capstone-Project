# 4E-Capstone-Project
> This is an academic project completed by students of the University of Pittsburgh's MS in Quantitative Economics program, advised by Pittsburgh consulting firm Fourth Economy. We use data ranging from 2008-2017 to show how higher unemployment and housing affordability gaps leads to higher rates of evictions, and how this effect is different across counties with different rurality or racial breakdowns.

## General info
The Covid-19 global pandemic has brought about a wave of joblessness and housing insecurity for millions of American families. This analysis aims to explore the extent to which this negative unemployment shock causes housing displacement among renters in all US counties, specifically in counties that were already facing housing shortages prior to the pandemic.

## Technologies
* Analysis built within Jupyter Notebook - R 4.0 Kernel
* Interactive chloropleth map - Python
* Interactive housing market dashboard - Google Data Studio
